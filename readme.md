
# EchoFlow

**EchoFlow** is a modular, scalable Python-based application designed to streamline the process of **downloading**, **transcribing**, and **analyzing** audio content. With a strong focus on extensibility, maintainability, and efficiency, EchoFlow leverages modern software engineering principles and tools to deliver a robust foundation for handling audio pipelines.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

1. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Modular design adhering to **SOLID** and **DRY** principles.
   - Centralized dependency management using `Dependency Injector`.
   - Well-defined **pipelines** for handling complex processes.

2. **Pipeline Management**
   - **Four Core Pipelines**:
     - **Download Pipeline**: Handles video and audio downloads.
     - **Audio Pipeline**: Manages audio preprocessing and enhancement.
     - **Text Pipeline**: Processes and refines transcriptions.
     - **Transcription Pipeline**: Converts audio to text using tools like `OpenAI Whisper`.
   - **Pipeline Manager**: Coordinates interactions between pipelines while maintaining separation of concerns.

3. **Extensible Foundation**
   - Incorporates clean coding principles such as **SRP**, **SOLID**, and **DRY**.
   - Designed for future integration with Django for a web-based interface.

4. **Modern Development Practices**
   - Dependency and environment management using `Poetry` and `Pydantic`.
   - Pre-configured logging and performance monitoring to ensure reliability.

5. **Future-Proof**
   - Prepared for integration with task queues (`Celery`), database systems, and REST APIs.
   - Flexible configuration using `.env` and environment variables.

## 🛠️ **What We've Built So Far**

### 1. **Foundation**
- A well-structured project setup with **Dependency Injection** for centralized control of services and utilities.
- Core global features, such as a **Logger**, **Performance Tracker**, **HealthCheck Module**, and **FileManagerFacade**.

### 2. **Logger and Performance Tracker**
- A global, singleton-based logging system using `structlog` for clear and efficient logging.
- A performance tracker module to monitor key operations, ensuring system metrics are logged and tracked.

### 3. **HealthCheck Module**
- Independent health monitoring to assess the operational status of critical components.
- Ensures issues in dependencies are identified and logged early.

### 4. **File Manager**
- A robust **FileManagerFacade** that handles:
  - File and directory operations.
  - Safe filename sanitization.
  - File system integrity checks.

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- Dynamic configuration using **Pydantic** to handle environment variables and defaults.
- Default values and validation ensure safe, reliable configurations.

### 6. **Testing Framework**
- Comprehensive testing suite using `pytest` for all core modules (`Logger`, `Performance Tracker`, `Config`, `HealthCheck`, `FileManagerFacade`, and `Main`).
- Mocked dependencies ensure unit tests are isolated from external resources.
