# EchoFlow

**EchoFlow** is a modular, scalable Python-based application designed to streamline the process of **downloading**, **transcribing**, and **analyzing** audio content. With a strong focus on extensibility, maintainability, and efficiency, EchoFlow leverages modern software engineering principles and tools to deliver a robust foundation for handling audio pipelines.

## 🌟 **Key Features**

1. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Built with a focus on modularity and scalability to accommodate future expansion.
   - Centralized dependency management using `Dependency Injector`.

2. **Audio Processing Pipelines**
   - Designed to process and analyze audio content efficiently.
   - Supports cutting-edge transcription tools like `OpenAI Whisper` and `WhisperX`.

3. **Extensible Foundation**
   - Incorporates clean coding principles such as SOLID and DRY.
   - Designed to integrate with Django for a future web-based interface.

4. **Modern Development Practices**
   - Dependency and environment management using `Poetry` and `Pydantic`.
   - Pre-configured logging and performance monitoring to ensure reliability.

5. **Future-Proof**
   - Prepared for integration with task queues (`Celery`), database systems, and REST APIs.
   - Flexible configuration using `.env` and environment variables.

## 🛠️ **What We've Built So Far**

### 1. **Foundation**
- A well-structured project setup with **Dependency Injection**.
- Centralized configuration management using **Pydantic** to handle environment variables and defaults.

### 2. **Logger and Performance Tracker**
- A global, singleton-based logging system using `structlog` for clear and efficient logging.
- A performance tracker module to monitor key operations, ensuring system metrics are logged and tracked.

### 3. **Configurable Settings**
- Dynamic configuration loaded via `.env` or environment variables for:
  - Application mode (`APP_ENV`)
  - Debug mode (`DEBUG`)
  - Log levels (`LOG_LEVEL`)
- Default values and validation ensure safe, reliable configurations.

### 4. **Testing Framework**
- Comprehensive testing suite using `pytest` for core modules (`Logger`, `Performance Tracker`, `Config`, and `Main`).
- Mocked dependencies ensure all components are unit-tested without requiring external resources.
